Our passion for optics is endless, with expert opticians and unique designs, we can bring our vision and products to life. . .Our Why: .One third of the global population (3 billion people) needs vision correction, making it the world’s biggest disability. 32 million Egyptians have visual impairment that can be avoided or improved. We are committed to spreading awareness, eradicating visual impairments, and providing expertise through our eye care professionals. . .Our How: .By utilizing the advantages of the internet coupled with 14 stores around Egypt, we are aiming to serve our clients better and faster than ever before. Our commitment to quality made us partner with the second largest eyewear producer worldwide; Safilo based in Italy. Making us perfectly positioned for the future. Eyewear is personal, and our promise to our customers is exceptional customer care and integrity in every interaction. . .Job Description .Job Title:         Performance Marketing Specialist .Department:  E-Commerce .Reporting to:  Business Development Manager . .What you’ll be doing: .Analytics sits at the very center of our decision making, we are a data driven company focusing on optimization in every business function. Therefore, we are looking for a talented and energetic candidate to join our team and join our fastest growing department - the ecommerce team. We spend heavily on facebook, google, and tiktok ads and need a expereinced person to lead this task. . .Data-Mining Responsibilities .A key part of an e-commerce business analyst’s job description is reviewing data and making recommendations based on what the analyst finds after a review of the site’s visitor activity. For example, analysts look at how people get to an e-commerce site (e.g., via links, organic searches, or other methods). They look at product searches visitors perform and the keywords they enter. Analysts look at how customers proceed to different pages on the website, such as how many click on a product, how many visited a collection page, how many add the product to a shopping cart, how many leave the site before checking out and how many check out. .While looking at sales figures is an important part of an e-commerce business analyst’s job description, we look to hire analysts who can tell them why a company’s e-commerce performance is what it is, not just how many and what types of sales they are experiencing. Businesses don’t need an analyst to tell them sales figures they already know. .Looking For Patterns .E-commerce business analysts look for patterns among buyers and non-buyers to see if they can spot opportunities or problems. For example, the analyst might notice that many people who start checking out leave after they see the shipping options. Analysts might find out that many customers leave before checking out after they read reviews. Analysts look at the behaviour of members vs. guests. .An analyst looks to see how successful a site’s upselling techniques are. Upselling occurs when a company asks someone during the checkout process if they’d like to purchase a related product or take advantage of another program. . .Making Recommendations to Leadership .Once they have studied visitor behaviour at an e-commerce website and found patterns, analysts make recommendations to the marketing team to help reduce problems or take advantage of opportunities. .For example, using the keywords entered by customers who eventually purchase, an analyst can make keyword recommendations to the marketing team to help them improve product descriptions of keyword ads. If people leave at a certain point during the checkout process, the analyst tries to determine why and alerts the marketing team. .Analysts also use the e-commerce site they are reviewing just as a customer would to evaluate the user experience. If they find something confusing, they pass this on to marketing. They might make recommendations such as the addition or improvement of the site’s keyword search autofill. .The analyst will also be involved in the analytics of the retail stores. Identifying similarities with the online sales channels and finding optimizations the retail team can use. . .","Bachelor’s degree in business, MIS, Computer Science, or related major.At least 3 years in a business analyst positionExcellent analytical skills with a firm knowledge of Microsoft office tools, specifically Microsoft excelFamiliarity with a broad array of internet technologies and trendsPreferably an experience in IT or eBusiness or analysisStrong communication skills across business and technical audiences",
